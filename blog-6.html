                <h2>5 Types of AI to Propel Your Business and Purpose</h2>
                <p>Artificial intelligence enables a computer system to be trained and apply the gained knowledge to new inputs. This ability rests upon math and algorithms and is applicable only to the tasks that the system has been trained to perform. To visualize the AI concept clearer, you may think of a chatbot whose task is to help restaurant visitors to book a table. By nature, this chatbot is a computer program that is trained on tons of booking-a-table questions and relevant answers. That’s how it learns of a typical conversation flow on the topic. After the training, the chatbot can dialogue with customers. However, if a customer deviates from the main topic of booking a table and asks for food recommendations, the chatbot in question is of little help as it is not trained to perform this task.

                        <p>Powered with machine learning (including its most advanced deep learning techniques), analytic AI scans tons of data for dependencies and patterns to ultimately produce recommendations or provide a business with insights, thus contributing to data-driven decision-making. Sentiment analysis and supplier risk assessment are just a few examples of analytic AI in action. If you’d like to get a complete picture of how such a solution works, our experts have summarized the insights gained from their experience with two of the use cases – inventory optimization and demand forecasting.
